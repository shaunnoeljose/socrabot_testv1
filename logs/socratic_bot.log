2025-06-27 18:50:29,663 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: That's a good start for the first blank! You've picked a name.

Now, thinking about how we tell Python that "shaun" is a *name* (a sequence of characters), how do we usually represent text in Python? What special characters do we use around text?
2025-06-27 18:51:01,542 - socratic_bot - INFO - User: " "
2025-06-27 18:51:08,626 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: That's a good start for the first blank! You've correctly identified that you'd put the name there.

Now, thinking about the second blank: `print("Hello,", ___)`

If `user_name` holds the value "shaun", how would you use the `user_name` variable itself in the `print` statement to display "Hello, Shaun"?

2025-06-27 18:51:36,592 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: You're on the right track with `"shaun"` for the first blank! That's a perfect way to assign a name to the `user_name` variable.

Now, let's look at the second blank: `print("Hello,", ___)`. You put `"user_name"` there.

What do you think is the difference between writing `user_name` (without quotes) and `"user_name"` (with quotes) when you want to display the value stored in a variable?

2025-06-27 18:52:02,741 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: You're on the right track with "shaun"!

When we want to store text in a variable, we need to make sure Python knows it's text. How do we usually mark text values in Python? Think about the `user_name = "___"` line – what's already there that gives you a clue?

2025-06-27 18:52:39,550 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: You're on the right track with "shaun"! When we put text inside quotation marks, what kind of data do we call that in Python? And how does that relate to what we're trying to store in `user_name`?

2025-06-27 18:53:13,074 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: You're right, we're talking about strings!

Now that you know what a string is, think about the first blank: `user_name = "___"`.

If `user_name` is supposed to store a name, and a name is text, what kind of value should go inside those double quotes to represent the name "Shaun"? How would you write "Shaun" as a string?

2025-06-27 18:53:49,836 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: You're on the right track thinking about "strings"!

For the first blank, you suggested "shaun". When we want to store text like a name, how do we typically enclose that text in Python so the computer knows it's a string? Think about the example `user_name = "___"`. What do you notice about the existing "___" and the text already around it?
2025-06-27 18:54:15,940 - socratic_bot - INFO - User: we need to enclose shaun with ""
2025-06-27 18:54:18,231 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: You're thinking along the right lines about enclosing "shaun" with `""`! Why do you think those quotation marks are important in that specific spot?

Now, considering the second blank: `print("Hello,", ___)`. What do you think should go there to make the code print "Hello, Shaun"?
2025-06-27 18:54:52,121 - socratic_bot - INFO - User: "Shaun"
2025-06-27 18:54:55,416 - socratic_bot - INFO - Bot: You're on the right track thinking about "strings" and "enclosing"!

For the first blank (`user_name = "___"`), you're trying to assign the name "Shaun" to the variable `user_name`.

In Python, how do we typically write a piece of text, like a name, so that the computer recognizes it as a string? Think about the characters we use to mark the beginning and end of a string.
